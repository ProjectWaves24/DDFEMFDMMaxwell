# DDFEMFDMMaxwell

The directory contains data used in the production of results in the paper

L. Beilina, E. Lindstr√∂m, A domain decomposition finite element/finite difference method
 for permittivity reconstruction from time-dependent scattered data in conductive media, submitted.

All inp-files can be visualized in paraview.

GeomTest1.zip contains following files which were used for generation of data on 3 times locally refined mesh for Test 1: epsref3.m (file with exact epsilon), sigmaref3.m  (file with exact sigma), ref3.inp (file with   finite element mesh). 

MeshesTest2.zip contains following files which were used for generation of data  on 3 times locally  refined meshes for Test 2: epsref3.m (file with exact epsilon), sigmaref3.m (file with exact sigma), ref3.inp (file with   finite element mesh ) 

Test1noise10.zip contains final results of reconstructed epsilon on different refined meshes.
Test2noise10.zip contains final results of reconstructed epsilon obtained on different locally refines meshes.
