The file ID_012204.zip  contains Matlab code for producing original  and sampled data used in adaptive C++/PETSc code.
To be able  use Matlab's code one need download data files

All inp-files can be visualized in paraview.

GeomTest1.zip contains following files which were used for generation of data on 3 times locally refined mesh for Test 1: epsref3.m (file with exact epsilon), sigmaref3.m  (file with exact sigma), ref3.inp (file with   finite element mesh). 

MeshesTest2.zip contains following files which were used for generation of data  on 3 times locally  refined meshes for Test 2: epsref3.m (file with exact epsilon), sigmaref3.m (file with exact sigma), ref3.inp (file with   finite element mesh ) 

Test1noise10.zip contains final results of reconstructed epsilon on different refined meshes.
Test2noise10.zip contains final results of reconstructed epsilon obtained on different locally refines meshes.
